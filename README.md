# Will the Customer Purchase Your Product?  A Predictive Analytics Approach

## Overview

As a business owner, one of the key priorities is understanding whether customers will purchase your product again, maintain loyalty, and avoid churn. Ultimately, everything revolves around the customer, as they determine the long-term sustainability of the business.

This project applies predictive analytics to assess customer behavior, identify purchasing trends, and calculate key performance metrics like churn rate, retention rate, and Net Promoter Score (NPS) using a comprehensive e-commerce dataset sourced from Kaggle.

##  Objectives

* Analyze customer purchasing behavior by age, gender, and value.
* Calculate customer churn rate and NPS.
* Build a predictive model to determine likelihood of repeat purchases.
* Provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer engagement and retention.

##  Dataset

The dataset (`shopping_trends.csv`) includes the following key features:

* Customer ID
* Age
* Gender
* Purchase Amount (USD)
* Review Rating
* Frequency of Purchases
* Promo Code Used
* Discount Applied
* Product Category

## Data Exploration

Basic checks and statistics were performed to understand the dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

def load_data():
    return pd.read_csv("data/shopping_trends.csv")

data = load_data()
print(data.head())
print(data.info())
print(data.describe())
```

## Key Insights:

* Age: Average is 44 years (range: 18–70).
* Purchase Amount: Mean of \$59.76 (range: \$20–\$100).
* Review Rating: Average is 3.75/5.
* Previous Purchases: Average of 25, indicating repeat buying behavior.

### Age-Based Analysis
```
import pandas as pd
from  Load_Data import load_data

# Load the data using the reusable function
data = load_data()

# create age group
bins = [18, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 101]
labels = ['18-29', '30-39', '40-49', '50-59', '60-69', '70-79', '80-89', '90-100']
data['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(data['Age'], bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)

# Sorting the age group
df = data.sort_values(by='AgeGroup', ascending=True)
df.head()

# Spending as per age group

total_spending_by_age = df.groupby('AgeGroup', observed=True)['Purchase Amount (USD)'].sum().reset_index()
total_spending_by_age.columns = ['AgeGroup', 'Total_Spending']
total_spending_by_age

# Average review rating by age group
Age_review = df.groupby('AgeGroup', observed=True)['Review Rating'].mean().reset_index()
print(Age_review)
``

Customers aged 18–29 are the top spenders, contributing \~\$52,905. Spending is stable from **30–69**, then drops sharply beyond age 70.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Gender-Based Analysis

* **Male** customers spent **\$157,890** vs **\$75,191** by **females**.
* Both genders prefer **Clothing** and **Accessories**.
* **Outerwear** is the least purchased across both groups.

### 🧮 Value-Based Analysis

Customers were categorized as:

* **High-Value**: Above median total spending.
* **Low-Value**: Below median spending.

Additionally:

* **539 customers** make **weekly purchases**, showing strong recurring engagement.

## 📈 Net Promoter Score (NPS)

NPS was calculated based on review ratings:

```python
data['NPS_Category'] = pd.cut(data['Review Rating'], bins=[2.5, 3.33, 4.17, 5],
                              labels=['Detractors', 'Passives', 'Promoters'], right=False)

nps_counts = data['NPS_Category'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
nps_score = nps_counts.get('Promoters', 0) - nps_counts.get('Detractors', 0)
```

### NPS Results:

* **Detractors**: 33.5%
* **Passives**: 32.7%
* **Promoters**: 31%
* **NPS Score**: **-1.59**

➡️ **Conclusion**: Customer loyalty is low, and experience improvement is necessary to convert detractors into promoters.

## 🤖 Predictive Analytics

We used a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict if a customer is likely to purchase next month:

### Feature Engineering:

* **Used\_Promo**, **Used\_Discount**
* **Previous Purchases**
* **Purchase Amount**

```python
X = data[['Previous Purchases', 'Purchase Amount (USD)', 'Used_Discount', 'Used_Promo']]
y = data['Likely_To_Purchase_Next_Month']
```

### Model Results:

* **Overall Accuracy**: 62%
* **Precision (Non-buyers)**: 0.71
* **Recall (Non-buyers)**: 0.77
* **Precision (Buyers)**: 0.27
* **Recall (Buyers)**: 0.22

➡️ The model is good at detecting **non-buyers**, but **struggles with buyers**, limiting its use for targeting repeat purchasers.

---

## 🔁 Churn Analysis

```python
churned = data['Likely_To_Purchase_Next_Month'] == 0
churn_rate = churned.mean() * 100
```

* **Churn Rate**: **72%**
* Indicates that most customers are **not expected to return** next month.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The findings indicate that:

* **Customer churn is high (72%)**.
* **NPS score is negative (-1.59)**, showing dissatisfaction.
* **The predictive model struggles to identify loyal customers**, but can identify churned ones.

While segments like **young adults (18–29)** and **male shoppers** show potential, broader loyalty and satisfaction improvements are needed.
